# Goals of this branch
- Binding the "DoBeLikeScript.psc" to a quest (?) with C++

# Plugin skeleton for CommonLibSSE-NG
- Generates a .dll file from C++
- Compiles all Papyrus code from PSC to PEX
- All above is saved in Vortex's stage folder

# Disclaimer
I'm not sure what I'm doing, but my goal is to create simple Skyrim AE plugins to gain experience with Skyrim development.
You're welcome to use this code, but please keep in mind that it may not work and/or may have flaws.
